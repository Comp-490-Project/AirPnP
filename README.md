# AirPnP
AirPnP is a mobile application that operates on Android systems that address an issue that everyone encounters, finding a restroom when you need it the most. AirPnP addresses this common issue by allowing users to find restrooms that are just a short stream away. An interactive map with a myriad of possible restroom locations is fed to you, the user, so you may freely decide at your will where you would like to go. Features include the ability to leave reviews with a rating system reminiscent of yelp, the ability for users to sign up and bookmark particular restrooms, allowing registered users to add certain restrooms that arenâ€™t on the map, and much more.
